Research
======
Hydrological change detection and attribution research is the research topic of my Master's Thesis. The research redefined the concept of hydrological change, and fundamentally introduced the mechanism of hydrological change. An emphasis is placed on the state-of-the-art hydrological change detection system, which is put forward based on Hydrological statistics, Time series theory, Systems theory, Potential physical mechanism of hydrological change. The current research topic is developing a comprehensive sub-period calibration framework to improve the accuracy of hydrological forecasting by improving process representation and optimization scheme, which is further integrated with reservoir scheduling.
