<b>Abstract:</b> In shortage of water resources areas, the traditional allocation of water resources with supply and demand balance as the core, which maximized water use efficiency and achieved good economic benefits. At the same time, it would also lead to a series of environmental and ecological issues, and the only way to solve above problems is to control ET. This paper describes the general idea of ET-based allocation of water resources, emphasizing the concept of ET, discussing the calculation method of the objective ET and current comprehensive ET, and further analyzing the allocation mechanism of objective ET and implementing scheme of efficient water planning. Meanwhile, a case study in Luannan, according to its water resources that used mainly in agriculture, landforms uniform and so on, this paper proposes the methods to calculate the objective ET and current comprehensive ET, and allocation scheme of objective ET. Through analysis and evaluation, this paper verified the superiority of water resources allocation based on ET.<br>
